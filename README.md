# What is Budget Book
Budget Book is a Budget monitoring software designed to help you track your budget heads and improve your budget decision making.

Budget Book is designed to run on any browser and can be hosted on the internet or even on an individual machine.

The software was built with HTML, PHP and MySQL using Zend Framework 3.



#Why Use Budget Book
Budgeting and Budgetary Control is an important part of planning and management and in most cases available accounting software and other tools available for budget monitoring are very complex.

Budget Book is built with the user in mind outside the complexity of today's accounting packages. Budget monitoring with Budget Book involves three step that are as simple as browsing any web page.

Virtually any working computer with a browser installed can run Budget book once it installed.

#System Requirement
To be able to install Budget Book the system should have a local server installed and for this purpose I recommend the XAMPP server.
